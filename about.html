  <p>About Me – Handmade by Hannah
    Hi, I’m Hannah, the owner of Handmade by Hannah, a small cake studio based in Leicestershire. I’ve been creating wedding and celebration cakes since 2008, 
    turning a lifelong love of baking into a business I truly adore. 
    I work from my custom-built cake kitchen and serve customers across the East Midlands, including Leicester, Hinckley, Market Bosworth, and beyond.</p>

    <p>
        With over 15 years of experience in the wedding industry, I take pride in designing cakes that not only look beautiful but taste amazing too. 
        Every cake I make is crafted with care, and I personally guide each customer through the process—from the first design ideas to delivery or collection.</p>

   <p>
    Because I run the business myself, I’m able to offer a completely personal and friendly service. 
    I also understand how important it is to cater to different dietary needs, so I offer gluten-free, dairy-free, egg-free, nut-free, 
    and vegan options to ensure everyone can enjoy a slice</p>
